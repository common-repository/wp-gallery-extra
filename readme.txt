The most intuitive and extensible gallery management tool ever created for WordPress.

**A brand new algorithm**

There are dozens of WordPress photo galleries out there, but the problem is that they always look the same!
[**WordPress Gallery Extra**](https://wgextra.iprodev.com/) uses a brand new algorithm to make much more interesting image grids.

The **WordPress Gallery Extra** is fully responsive and it adapts to the browser using a nice and smooth animation, even on mobile devices because it can use the hardware acceleration taking advantage of CSS3 properties.
